ListViewAnimationXamarin.Android
================================

Apply animation to the ListView by using existing java library in Xamarin.Android.


I have created ListView animation using [nhaarman/ListViewAnimations](https://github.com/nhaarman/ListViewAnimations) java project. See the [Play Store Demo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haarman.listviewanimations) 

Demo includes the Appearance Animation. When the ListView items appears first time. If you want to know more and change the animation type follow this guide: https://github.com/nhaarman/ListViewAnimations/wiki/Appearance-Animations
